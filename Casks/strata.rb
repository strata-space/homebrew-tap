  # The bundled CLI binary (Contents/Helpers/strata) targets macOS 11+, so
  # `strata link` live-sync works on Big Sur and newer. `strata mount` (FSKit)
  # additionally needs macOS 15.4 and is gated at runtime by `detect_backend()`,
  # which prints an actionable "macOS 15.4+ required" error on older systems.
